Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of objects representing students, where each object contains the student's name and grade. Use a Map to store the students' names as keys and their grades as values. Then, use a for...of loop to iterate over the Map and log the name and grade of each student who scored above 90.

Example:
const students = [
    { name: 'John Doe', grade: 85 },
    { name: 'Jane Doe', grade: 92 },
    { name: 'Bob Smith', grade: 78 },
    { name: 'Alice Johnson', grade: 95 }
];

Example Output:
Jane Doe: 92
Alice Johnson: 95
